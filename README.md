# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI

A Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring an unbeatable AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 Intelligent AI opponent using Minimax algorithm
- 👥 Player vs AI gameplay
- 🎯 Clean command-line interface
- ⚡ Optimal move calculation
- 🎲 Multiple difficulty levels
- 📊 Real-time game state visualization

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No additional packages required!

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TaneshG13/Tik-Tak-Toe-AI-Using-Python.git
cd Tik-Tak-Toe-AI-Using-Python
```

2. Run the game
```bash
python tictactoe.py
```

## 🎯 How to Play

1. The game board is numbered from 1-9:
```
 1 | 2 | 3 
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6 
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9 
```

2. Enter a number (1-9) to place your mark (X) in the corresponding position
3. The AI will respond with its move (O)
4. Try to get three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win!

## 🤖 About the AI

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to:
- Analyze all possible future moves
- Choose the optimal move
- Create an unbeatable opponent (in standard mode)
- Provide a challenging and engaging gaming experience

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- Written in pure Python
- Implements the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Uses recursive game state evaluation
- Optimized for performance
